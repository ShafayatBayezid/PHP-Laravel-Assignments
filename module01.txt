Question 1. What is the Feasibility Study of the SDLC model & why is this important?

Answer: A Feasibility Study in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is an evaluation of a proposed software project to determine whether it is technically and economically feasible. It is important because it helps determine the viability of a project before investing significant time and resources into it. By identifying potential problems and risks early on, a Feasibility Study can save the project team from wasting time and money on a project that may not be successful. Additionally, it helps the team to prioritize requirements, allocate resources, and develop a realistic project plan.

Question 2. Write 5 advantages of Agile methodology.

Answer: The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. 5 advantages of agile methodology are given bellow.

  a. Flexibility and adaptability: Agile methodology allows teams to easily adapt to changing requirements and priorities, making it ideal for projects with rapidly evolving requirements.

  b. Collaboration and communication: Agile methodology emphasizes close collaboration between team members and stakeholders, leading to better communication and a more efficient project.

  c. Faster delivery: Agile methodology prioritizes the delivery of working software over documentation, allowing teams to quickly deliver value to the end-user.

  d. Continuous improvement: Agile methodology encourages continuous improvement and feedback, leading to higher quality software and increased customer satisfaction.

  e. Higher visibility and accountability: Agile methodology provides greater visibility into the project's progress, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and holding the team accountable for delivering results.

Question 3. Write short notes on SDLC model phase.

Answer: SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. There are 7 model phases are given bellow.

  a. Requirements Gathering: The first phase of the SDLC, where stakeholders gather and define the requirements for the software project.

  b. Analysis: In this phase, the requirements are analyzed and a high-level design of the solution is created.

  c. Design: Detailed design of the solution is developed in this phase, including the architecture, user interface, and database design.

  d. Development: This is the actual implementation phase, where the software is built based on the design.

  e. Testing: The software is tested in this phase to identify and fix any defects or bugs.

  f. Deployment: The final phase, where the software is deployed and made available to the end-user.

  g. Maintenance: Ongoing support and maintenance of the software to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the end-user.
